environments.

You can specify the file code at Upload As dialog.

Tips for Guardian environment
---------------------------------------------------------------

When you upload to Guardian environment by "Filename Depend", "ASCII
mode Filenames" setting is used. So it is useful that "*.c/*.h/*.config/
*.pl" are added to ASCII mode Filenames of "Option - Transfer1".
This is a global setting.

When ASCII mode filenames are uploaded to Guardian environment, ASCII
mode transfer is choosen. Otherwise, binary mode transfer is choosen.

EXTENT and MAXEXTENTS
---------------------------------------------------------------

HP Default FTPSERV program creates a file with EXT (4,28) MAXEXTENTS 978
as a default. When the file size is over than it, upload operation fails
with File Full (Error 45).

FFFTP calculates the EXTENT and MAXEXTENT automatically when uploading
to Guardian environment with binary mode transfer.

Target used ratio is 75 % and MAXEXTENTS is maximum (978). But NonStop
NS Series or later adjusts the EXTENT and MAXEXTENTS when it is not
multiples of 14. So it may be that the target used ratio is not accurate.

When you wonder the EXTENT and MAXEXTENT size, you can see the calculated
size by FFFTP at console window as the follows.

  STOR Filename,FileCode,Primary,Secondary,MaxExtents

When an append mode transfer is used, EXTENT and MAXEXTENS are not
specified. This is a limitation at this version.
